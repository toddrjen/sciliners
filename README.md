Numeric, engineering, and science-oriented one-liners for python

Scipy developers prefer to avoid having one-liners or other very simply
functions in their code base.  This is an understandable approach, but it
requires everyone keep their own set of personal one-liners on hand.
This project is a set of such one-liners and other simple functions that
would otherwise be appropriate for a project like numpy or scipy.

Functions that were dropped from numpy or scipy for being too simple are
also appropriate here.

It is still in the very early stages of development and only has a few
functions.  Additional functions are appreciated!

Code should conform to scipy code standards.  Unit tests and documentation
are required.
